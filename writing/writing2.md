For this assignment, you will write a 2-3 page paper exploring the
role of creativity in a particular domain.

First, pick some *field of human endeavor*. This is somewhat vague,
but we are trying to make it broad on purpose.  For example:

* You could pick a particular academic field of study, like biology,
  psychology, politics, chemistry, ...
* You could pick some kind of *activity* such as a sport or hobby.
* You could pick some kind of *profession* or job that people do.
* You could also pick something else that does not fit in any of the
  categories above, as long as it is a *thing that people do*.

Ideally, you should pick something you are personally interested in,
such as a subject you like to study, a favorite activity or hobby, or
a profession that you intend to pursue.  In this case you can use your
own personal perspective to help you answer the prompt. However,
picking something with a personal connection is not a requirement.

Prompt
------

Reflect on the role that creativity plays in your chosen activity or
field of endeavor.  For example, you might consider questions such as:

* What are some ways to be creative while pursing the activity?  Which
  aspects of the activity require creativity and which do not?  To
  what extent is creativity neccessary to *engage* productively with
  the activity or its community?
* What does *productive failure* in the activity look like, and how
  does it relate to being creative?
* What, if anything, makes the activity distinctly human?
* How is creativity viewed by the community of people who do the
  activity?  How is creativity related (or not) to who has power in
  the community?

**Be sure to connect your reflection to multiple topics or
readings/videos discussed in the course.**
