## <a name="goals">Learning Goals</a>

* Comprehend and appreciate a set of complex issues relevant to being
  engaged citizens.
* Make connections between the evidence and methods from two distinct
  disciplines in order to formulate arguments about engaged citizenship.
* Express those arguments clearly in writing and discussion.
* Engage in and reflect on experiential learning that connects
  directly to the classroom experience, preparing you for vibrant
  Odyssey experiences later in your Hendrix career.

## <a name="calendar">Calendar</a>

If you are in Section 1, you should only look at the
**left** column of the calendar. If you are in section 2, look only
at the <b>right</b> column.  The color of each date tells you whether
your section will be taught by <span class="gill">Prof.
Gill</span>, <span class="yorgey">Dr. Yorgey</span>, or whether we
will <span class="group">all meet together</span>.

## <a name="grading">Grading Policies</a>

Grading for this course uses a cumulative, points-based system.  Each
assignment will be worth a certain number of points; points earned on
all assignments will be added to determine the total points earned in
the course.  Your final letter grade will then be determined using the
following scale, out of a possible 1100 points:

| Points   | Grade |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| 950-1100 | A     |
| 850-949  | B     |
| 750-849  | C     |
| 650-749  | D     |
| < 650    | F     |

### <a name="rolling">Rolling submissions</a>

Projects and writing assignments will be accepted and graded on a
**rolling** basis:

* Each assignment has a deadline which is the absolute last day on
  which you may submit it.
* However, you are strongly encouraged to turn in the assignment any
  time **before** the deadline.  If you are really on the ball you
  could even do it and turn it in the day after it is assigned!
* We will return the submitted assignment
  to you, with a grade and feedback, **within two working days** (M-F)
  of when you submit it.
* If you wish, you may then revise the assignment, taking our feedback
  into account, and resubmit it (as long as it is still before the
  deadline). In fact, you can repeat this cycle several times if you
  start early enough!
* Your grade for the assignment will simply be the grade you earn on
  your **last** submission before the deadline.

## <a name="writing">Writing Assignments</a>

You will complete two writing assignments in the course.  You will be
given several weeks to complete each assignment, in which you will
draw on class discussions and assignments to explore a particular set
of questions.

For each writing assignment, we will have a "workshop
day" where you will give and receive peer feedback on a draft. You are
also welcome and encouraged to make use of [rolling
submission](#rolling) to get feedback from us as well.
