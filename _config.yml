  This hands-on course takes the central topic of creativity and
  examines it from two different disciplines: Computer Science and Fine
  Art Printmaking. Students will use a range of processes, both digital
  and physical, to produce creative visual artwork. Students will also
  engage with big questions such as: What is creativity? How is
  creativity important to engaged citizenship? What does a ‘virtuous’
  society look like in terms of creating? How is creating both easier
  and more difficult in the digital age, and how does it intersect with
  authorship, copyright, and the open source/free culture movements?
