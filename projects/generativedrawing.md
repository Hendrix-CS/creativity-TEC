[EscherSketch](https://eschersket.ch/), you will explore creating some
generative artwork.

Project due **{{page.due}} @5pm** (the first day of Unit 2).

Guidelines
----------

- Explore the tools XXX
- Explain how to take screenshots
- Create at least three different images XXX

Your submitted images should be XXX


Reflection
----------

You should write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on your process of
creativity and discovery.  For example, you might consider questions
such as:

  - To what extent did you feel that you were in control of the
    process?  Did it make you feel excited? Anxious? Curious?
    Contemplative? etc.?
  -

Your reflection need not answer *all* the above questions; these are
just example prompts to get you thinking.  You will not be graded on
things like grammar, punctuation, etc. (although writing well is
always a goal worth striving for); I simply want to see evidence of
thoughtful reflection.
