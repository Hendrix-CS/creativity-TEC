Description
-----------

This project takes inspiration from American artist Sol LeWitt's
influential body of work titled "Wall Drawings" which began in the
1960s and '70s. As a conceptual artist, LeWitt created a plan&mdash;a
list of instructions for others to execute on the wall. His work asks
important questions about artistic authorship and the relationship
between the idea and the artwork a given idea might produce. In the
present digital era, we can see connections between LeWitt's approach
to his art and the relationship between a computer programmer, the
program, and what is produced. In both cases, a set of instructions
(like a program) is made by one person, which becomes a mechanism for
another (whether person or machine) to create art.

For this project, working in pairs, you will adopt Sol LeWitt's
approach of making a list of instructions in two formats, digital and
analog, to create two works of art.

### Analog

Each person creates a written list of instructions for their partner
to carry out on paper to generate a dynamic drawing with depth,
texture, and variety of shape. Like LeWitt, you will limit yourself to
only basic lines and shapes and use repetition strategically to create
depth and movement in the image.

### Digital

You and your partner should discuss and decide which of the three
digital tools (recursivedrawing.com, EscherSketch, or Context Free
Art) you will use for your digital artwork.  Both partners must use
the same tool.

Each person creates a written list of instructions for their partner
to carry out using the chosen digital tool to generate a dynamic image
with depth, texture, and a variety of shape. Note that these tools
already necessarily limit you to using only basic lines and shapes, as
in LeWitt's work, although of course the possibility of much smaller
and more numerous repetitions can create the illusion of more complex,
organic shapes.

Reflection
----------

Each partner should write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on your creative
process in this project.  For example, you might consider questions
such as:

  - Did you feel you were exhibiting more creativity when writing
    instructions for your partner, or when executing your partner's
    instructions (or about the same)?
  - ???

Your reflection does **not** need to answer all the above questions,
and you could also answer other, related questions instead.  These
are just example prompts to get you thinking.  You will not be graded
on things like grammar, punctuation, etc. (although writing well is
always a goal worth striving for); we simply want to see evidence of
thoughtful reflection.


What to turn in
---------------

Decide which partner will actually submit your files.  They will
collect all the files (as described below) for both of you and upload
them all.  **Only one partner should submit.**

You should submit:

* Two sets of analog instructions and two sets of digital instructions.
    * The format does not matter: photos of handwritten instructions,
      Word docs, and PDF files are all acceptable.
    * Be sure each set of instructions is clearly labelled to show
      which partner wrote them, and which partner executed them.
* Good photos of the two finished analog drawings on paper.
* Two image files containing the finished digital images.
    * See the [Generative Drawing project
      description](generativedrawing.html) for information on how to
      save images from each tool.
* A written reflection from each partner.  Word or PDF documents are
  both acceptable.

You should be **submitting a total of TEN files** (four sets of
instructions, two photos, two digital images, and two reflections).

All files [should be uploaded via this DropBox
link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/HiKJpRt7ye3L4qPJvVCB).  Remember
that only *one* partner needs to upload all the files.

Learning Goals
--------------

* Introduction to Conceptual art and Generative art
* Creative problem solving in both the digital and analog formats
* Introduction to the artist Sol LeWittâ€™s Wall Drawings
* Further development of collaboration skills
* Further development of digital and analog creative skills

Grading Criteria (Analog Instructions and Drawing)
--------------------------------------------------

Thoroughness and rigor: The finished drawing must have a substantial
amount of mark-making and variety to create a dynamic image. The final
drawing should be more ambitious than "safe."

Grading Criteria (Digital Program and Drawing)
