Description and examples
------------------------

In this project, you will produce a substantive creative work by
remixing and/or adapting creative works by others.

For example, you could:

- Write a story or poem that incorporates material from other texts.

- Use images, text, links, etc. to create a website that tells a story
  or communicates an idea.

- Use some images to make a collage (either using digital tools, or
  by printing out the images and making a physical collage), or
  digitally alter the images somehow.

- Download the code for one or more images in the [Context Free Art
  Gallery](https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/) and modify/combine
  them to make your own remix.

- Make a video that adapts/remixes other video and audio material.

These examples are not meant to be an exhaustive list of options.  You
should feel free to do something not on the above list (take a series
of photographs? make a painting? write a song? needlepoint
stitching?), or to mix multiple types of media, as long as you follow
the guidelines below.

The project is due at **{{page.duetime}} on {{page.due}}**.

Resources
---------

Below are some resources that may be helpful to you.  These are
also far from exhaustive; there is LOTS more creative work out there
licensed for adaptation and reuse! Just search for it.  For example,
if you want to find some modern poetry licensed for adaptation, you
certainly can---just do a Google search for something like "creative
commons poetry" and see what turns up.

- [Creative Commons search](https://search.creativecommons.org/)
- [Creative Commons list of sources](https://search.creativecommons.org/sources)
- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (public domain books)
    - For inspiration, see their [list of frequently viewed/downloaded
      books](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top), many of
      which you have probably heard of.
- [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/home)
- [Best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution)

Guidelines
----------

- You must somehow make use of **two or more** other creative works.

- The used portions or influence of the other creative works must be
  somehow **recognizable**.  For example, you can't just take a few
  colors from an image or only a word or two from a text. However,
  *recognizable* does not necessarily mean *obvious*.  It's OK if the
  use or influence of the other creative works needs to be pointed out
  in order to see it.

    - Note that you don't necessarily have to literally reuse portions
      of the other creative works.  For example, you could write a
      story whose plot closely mirrors another story, but with
      different characters and details.  This could be a recognizable
      use (especially if the other story has a well-known or easily
      recognizable plot) even if it does not literally quote any
      material from the other source.  For instance, this kind of
      thing is often done with Shakespeare plays (e.g. [Ten Things I
      Hate About
      You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You)).

- On the other hand, your use needs to be **transformative**.  That
  is, you must make something recognizably new; you are not just
  changing something about the existing creative works, but using them
  to make something new. For example, putting two poems one after the
  other, or changing a single word of a poem would not normally be
  considered transformative.

- The other creative works you use **must be explicitly available for
  adaptation and reuse** (*e.g.* in the public domain, oro licensed
  under a Creative Commons license without the `NoDerivatives` clause
  or some other suitable license).
    - Note that an argument could easily be made that adapting a
      creative work in a transformative way for a class project falls
      under [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) and
      hence would be allowed under copyright law.
    - However, the point is not (only) to make sure your project is legal
      but also to help you explore the ideas of free culture we have
      discussed in class.

- Creative works used **must be cited/attributed properly**.
    - For example, to properly attribute Creative Commons-licensed
      works, see [Best practices for
      attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution).
    - If you are not sure of the proper way to attribute a source,
      just ask.

- You must note your copyright and any license you wish to apply to
  your remixed/derivative work.
    - For example, you could write "Copyright 2020 by Firstname
      Lastname".
    - If any of the original creative works used are licensed under a
      `ShareAlike` license, then under the terms of that license you
      **must** use the same (or a more restrictive) license for your
      work.
    - Otherwise, you are strongly encouraged (though not required) to
      license your work under a Creative Commons license of your
      choosing. See [Marking your work with a CC
      license](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license)
      for help.

Reflection
----------

Along with your finished creative work, you should write a 1 page
reflection on your creative process.  For example, you might consider
questions such as:

- How did you choose other creative works to make use of in your
  project?  Was it easy or difficult to find them?
- How did the works you chose affect your own creative process?
- What was your creative process?  How you made use of your chosen
  creative works?
- Did your perspective on your chosen works or their creator(s) change
  as a result of using them in your own work?  If so, how?

Rubric
------

The project is worth 150 points, broken down as follows:

- 40 points: Your creative work displays **originality** and
  **effort** on your part.
- 10 points: Your work makes use of **at least two** other
  creative works.
- 20 points: Your work makes **transformative** use of
  the other works: not just repeating them but turning them into
  something else.
- 20 points: Your creative work uses the other works in a
  **recognizable** way (possibly with an explanation in the
  reflection).
- 10 points: Copyright notice
- 25 points: Proper attribution of works used
- 25 points: Reflection

Submission
----------

You should submit the following files by [uploading them to this
  Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/FWZaSNQbkDFQ4Skv18tF):

- Any files necessary to transmit your creative work or explain how to
  find it. For example:
    - A text document, if you created some kind of text
    - A `.jpg` or `.png` if you created some kind of image
    - A `.zip` file if you created a collection of images or texts
    - If you created something which requires a very large file (for
      example, audio or video), it may be easier to upload your work
      to a public site such as SoundCloud, Vimeo, or YouTube, and then
      simply submit a text document with a link to a URL where your
      project can be found.

- A text document containing your copyright declaration, license, and
  proper attribution of the other creative works you used.

- A text document describing and reflecting on your
  creative process, as explained above.

- If you choose, you may combine multiple text documents into one, as
  long as you are clear about the different sections.  For example, if
  you write a story, you could put the story, copyright, attributions,
  and reflection all in the same document.  Putting everything in one
  document is not necessarily better---do whatever you think is most
  clear.

- All files can be submitted via [this Dropbox
  link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/FWZaSNQbkDFQ4Skv18tF).
