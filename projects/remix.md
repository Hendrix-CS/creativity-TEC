Description and examples
------------------------

In this project, you will produce a substantive creative work by
remixing and/or adapting creative works by others.

For example, you could:

- Take some images and make a collage (either using digital tools, or
  by printing out the images and making a physical collage).

- Download the code for one or more images in the [Context Free Art
  Gallery](https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/) and modify/combine
  them to make your own remix.

- Write a story or poem that incorporates material from other texts.

- Make a video that adapts/remixes other video and audio material.

These examples are not meant to be an exhaustive list of options.  You
should feel free to do something not on the above list (take a series
of photographs? make a painting? write a song?), or to mix multiple
types of media, as long as you follow the guidelines below.

Resources
---------

Below are some resources that may be helpful to you.  These are
also far from exhaustive; there is LOTS more creative work out there
licensed for adaptation and reuse! Just search for it.  For example,
if you want to find some modern poetry licensed for adaptation, you
certainly can---just do a Google search for something like "creative
commons poetry" and see what turns up.

- Creative Commons search: https://search.creativecommons.org/

Guidelines
----------

- You must somehow make use of **two or more** other creative works.

- The used portions or influence of the other creative works must be
  somehow **recognizable**.  For example, you can't just take a few
  colors from an image or only a word or two from a text. However,
  *recognizable* does not necessarily mean *obvious*.  It's OK if the
  use or influence of the other creative works needs to be pointed out
  in order to see it.

- On the other hand, your use needs to be __transformative__.  That
  is, you must make something recognizably new.  You are not just
  changing something about the existing creative works, but using them
  to make something new. For example, putting two poems one after the
  other, or changing a single word of a poem would not normally be
  considered transformative.

- The other creative works you use **must be licensed for adaptation
  and reuse** (*e.g.* in the public domain, or licensed under a
  Creative Commons license without the `NoDerivatives` clause or some
  other suitable license).
    - Note an argument could easily be made that adapting a creative
      work in a transformative way for a class project falls under
      fair use and hence would be allowed under copyright law.
    - However, the point is not (only) to make sure your project is legal
      but also to help you explore the ideas of free culture we have
      discussed in class.

- Creative works used **must be cited/attributed properly**.
    - For example, to properly attribute Creative Commons-licensed
      works, see [Best practices for
      attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution).
    - If you are not sure of the proper way to attribute a source,
      just ask.

- You must note your copyright and any license you wish to apply to
  your remixed/derivative work.
    - For example, you could write "Copyright 2020 by Firstname
      Lastname".
    - If any of the original creative works used are licensed under a
      `ShareAlike` license, then under the terms of that license you
      **must** use the same (or a more restrictive) license for your
      work.
    - Otherwise, you are strongly encouraged (though not required) to
      license your work under a Creative Commons license of your
      choosing. See [Marking your work with a CC
      license](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license)
      for help.

Reflection
----------



What to turn in
---------------

- Any files necessary to submit your project.
    - A text document, if you created some kind of text
    - A `.jpg` or `.png` if you created some kind of image
    - If you created something which requires a very large file (for
      example, audio or video), it may be easier to upload your work
      to a public site such as SoundCloud, Vimeo, or YouTube, and
      simply submit a text document with a link to a URL where your
      project can be found.

- A text document containing your copyright declaration, license, and
  proper attribution of the other creative works you used.

- A text document describing and reflecting on your
  creative process, as explained above.

- If you wish, you may combine multiple text documents into one, as
  long as you are clear about the different sections.  For example, if
  you write a story, you could put the story, copyright and
  attributions, and reflection all in the same document.

- All files can be submitted via [this Dropbox
  link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/FWZaSNQbkDFQ4Skv18tF).
